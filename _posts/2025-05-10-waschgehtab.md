The Problem: No easy way of knowing if the washing machine, located in the basement and shared between three flats, is currently empty and ready to use. The Old Solution: walking down three sets of stairs to manually check, being disappointed to find a running machine. The New and Improved Solution: Build a web app to let users set the current status of the machine, so all residents can know the live status, including a time-left timer and a waiting queue, instantly.
