## Traffic Light Detection

For the course "..." I have been part of a project to develop a traffic light detection system. The system is developed using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and PyTorch. The system is able to detect traffic lights in images and classify them as red, yellow or green. The system is trained on a dataset of traffic light images and is able to achieve an accuracy of 90% on the test set.
