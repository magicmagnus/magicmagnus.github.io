Thesis: "[Implementing DISTANA in PyTorch Geometric and Deep Graph Library](https://github.com/magicmagnus/BSC-Kaut)"

The goals of this work are twofold: (a) make DISTANA available on the increasingly popular APIs and to investigate PyTorch Geometric's and Deep Graph Library's usability when it comes to implementing a self-developed model, and (b) compare DISTANA to other GNN models in PyTorch Geometric and Deep Graph Library in terms of accuracy and computational complexity (i.e. processing speed) on different benchmarks.
